# PLP-Order-Management-System
The Order Management System is a salesforce-based solution that automates the order creation process. This application is designed mainly for Sales users and Business users both have their appropriate object permission and data accessibilities. Sales users can create, edit, confirm, or cancel the orders whereas Business users can only view or approve high valued orders. Order related invoices are also generated automatically when an order gets confirmed. This solution also notifies the order stage changes to the contacts related to that order via email.
